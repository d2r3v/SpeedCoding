# General Instructions

+ You have 60 minutes (1h 5m) to complete the assigned tasks.
+ Take your time to read the question.

## Question 1: Almost Palindrome

> The skeleton source code for this question is in the package `fibbase`. You may import the provided code as a Gradle project in Eclipse.

Given a string, we need to check whether it is possible to make the string a palindrome after removing exactly one character from it.

### Test Cases

```java
@Test
public void test1() {
	assertEquals(true, FibBase.almostPalindrome("abcba"));
}
```
## Question 2: Multiplying Strings

> The skeleton source code for this question is in the package `fibbase`. You may import the provided code as a Gradle project in Eclipse.

Given two numbers as strings. The numbers may be very large, the task is to find product of these two numbers.
### Test Cases

```java
@Test
public void test2() {
	assertEquals(1, FibBase.MultiplyStrings(1,1));
}
```
